# Custom Video Player
For this project I removed the default stylings of the video player and created custom buttons and sliders.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

HTML is used to create the video player buttons and sliders.

CSS gives the styles to the video player.

JavaScript gives the custom buttons and sliders functionality.

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

I would like to add a full screen button and to be able to toggle play/pause with the space bar.

## Lessons Learned:

Creating a custom video player is a lot of fun and takes some creativity to style and create functions for each button. I learned how to edit the properties of a video element with my JavaScript and make each button and slider responsive to user clicks and drags.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
